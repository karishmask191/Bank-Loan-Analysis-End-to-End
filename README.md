# Bank Loan Analysis – End to End

## Project Overview
This is an end-to-end group data analytics project that analyzes bank loan customer data to evaluate loan performance, customer risk, and repayment behavior. 
The insights from this project support data-driven decision-making in banking and financial services.

## Business Objectives
- Identify trends in loan disbursement over time  
- Assess customer risk using credit grades and revolving balance  
- Compare repayment behavior of verified vs non-verified customers  
- Analyze regional loan performance and loan status  
- Understand the impact of home ownership on loan behavior  

## Datasets
- 2 datasets [finance_1 & finnace_2] (Excel/CSV format)  
- Each dataset contains 39K+ records  

## Data Preparation
- Initial data cleaning and validation were performed in **Excel**  
- Handled missing values and basic formatting issues  
- The **cleaned datasets** were then used for analysis in Excel, MySQL, Power BI, and Tableau  

## Key KPIs
1) Year-wise loan amount trends  
2) Grade & sub-grade wise revolving balance  
3) Total payment: Verified vs Non-Verified  
4) State-wise & last credit pull date loan status  
5) Home ownership vs last payment date  

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (data cleaning & initial analysis)  
- MySQL (analysis on cleaned data)  
- Power BI (interactive dashboards)  
- Tableau (visual analytics & storytelling)  

## Key Insights
- High-grade and verified customers show stronger repayment behavior  
- Higher revolving balance indicates higher credit risk  
- Loan performance varies across states and home ownership types

2. Loaded cleaned data into MySQL  
3. Created KPIs based on business requirements  
4. Built dashboards in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau  
5. Interpreted insights and documented findings
